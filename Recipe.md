Step 1 - Pre-Freeze your ice cream maker's gel container
Gel Freezer Container to make Ice creamBefore you even think about making ice cream, you better get the gel container in the deep freeze and start it freezing up.  Models vary, but generally the recommend
the length of time needed to freeze the unit is between 6 hours and 22 hours. It depends on how cold your freezer is. If you have the room, just leave your freezer bowl in the freezer at all times. That way, you can take it out any time for immediate use.

To determine whether the bowl is completely frozen, just shake it. If you don't hear liquid moving, it's frozen!  Before freezing the bowl, wash and dry the bowl, then place the freezer bowl in the back of your freezer where it is coldest. (Note: Your freezer should be set to 0 F for most foods, including ice cream!)

Step 2 - Heat the milk, sugar and powdered milk
MilkSugarNonfat powdered dry milkHeat the milk, sugar and powdered milkIn a large pot ( 4 quarts or larger) with a heavy bottom (for even heat distribution), mix the milk, sugar and powdered milk. Bring the mix to a low simmer over medium heat and stir to dissolve the sugar, then turn the heat down and just keep it warm.


Step 3 - Separate 8 egg yolks
Separate 8 egg yolkseggsSeparate the egg yolks from 8 large eggs. Just crack the eggs against the edge of the bowl and either pour them from one half of the shell to the other, or use your fingers to let the whites drop through while holding the yolk.

Step 4 - Whip the egg yolks until thickened
Whip the egg yolks until thickenedWhip the egg yolks until thickenedPut the egg yolks in a medium bowl and whisk until they are thickened (it only takes about 2 minutes.  I use a hand mixer on low speed.

Step 5 - Slowly add 1 cup of the hot milk mixture to the egg yolks
Slowly add 1 cup of the hot milk mixture to the egg yolksWhile constantly whisking, slowly add 1 cup of the hot milk mixture and whisk until it is blended (a few seconds).

Step 6 - Pour the egg yolk mix into the pot of hot milk
Pour the egg yolk mix into the pot of hot milkThen pour the egg mixture back into the pot of hot milk and increase heat to medium. Stir the mixture constantly with a wooden or plastic spoon, until the mixture is thickened (like gravy) and registers between 170 F and 180 F (check with an instant-read thermometer, like the ones with a probe).

Add the light cream (or half and half) and vanilla and refrigerate

Step 7 - Add the light cream (or half and half) and vanilla and refrigerate
Stir in whipping cream (or light cream or half-and-half) and vanilla. Cover and pop into the refrigerator for at least 6 hours before continuing on to step 8. Overnight or even 24 to 48 hours is fine. 

Step 8 - Prepare the fruit
Well, what kind of ice cream do you want?  This is the time to decide!  You can add almost any fruit you have!  If you want vanilla, you already have it, just pop the mix into the maker. If you want chocolate, just skip the fruit and add the chocolate syrup in step 10.  I add about 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup - I use the Hersey's sugar free syrup, but both the variety and amount are a matter of personal taste preferences!

Prepare the fruitFor a fruit flavor, well, some fruit work better than others.  You get best flavor if you puree the fruit first in your food processor or blender.  So obviously, fruits like strawberries, raspberries, mangoes, figs and peaches are idea for this, while apples, coconuts and pomegranates might not be such a good choice. 

To prepare the fruit just prepare it as you would for eating, then blend it in your food processor or blender for a few minutes. Here are some tips:

Peaches and nectarines: remove skins, pits and bruised areaschopped strawberries
Strawberries: remove the cap (the green parts)
Raspberries: just wash them
Blackberries: I like seedless, so I wash them and then run them through a Foley Food Mill to remove the seeds!
Figs: Remove stems and bruises
Mangoes: Peel, and cut the flesh off the stone.
Step 9 - Mix the milk/cream mix with the fruit
Mix the milk/cream mix with the fruitAbout 45 minutes before you want to serve the ice cream, stir the milk/cream mixture together with the pureed fruit. Stir it up well. Remove the freezer bowl and pour the milk/cream/fruit mixture from step 8 into the freezer bowl. Put the bowl in the cream maker. 

Step 10 - Fire up the ice cream maker!
Fire up the ice cream maker!Turn the ice cream maker on and let the maker work until it is thickened, about 20 to 25 minutes.Ice cream - done!

If you are making chocolate ice cream, this is the time to add the chocolate syrup.  I add about 1/2 cup of chocolate syrup - I use the Hersey's sugar free syrup, but both the variety and amount are a matter of personal taste preferences!

You can tell when the ice cream is done, by simply checking the consistency through the opening on the top of the ice cream maker.  You will also hear the motor straining, as the ice cream freezes.  On some units, the directions with the maker tell you to let it work until the motor stalls and stops.

When it is done, the ice cream should have a soft, creamy texture. If you want firmer, harder ice cream, transfer the ice cream to an airtight container and place it in freezer for about 2 hours. Remove from freezer about 15 minutes before serving.
